# Write your first_three_multiples function here:
def first_three_multiples(num):
  for n in range(1,3):
  	return num*3
# Uncomment these function calls to test your first_three_multiples function:
#first_three_multiples(10)
print(first_three_multiples(10))
# should print 10, 20, 30, and return 30
#first_three_multiples(0)
print(first_three_multiples(0))
# should print 0, 0, 0, and return 0
